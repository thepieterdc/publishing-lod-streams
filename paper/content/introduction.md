On top of the standard web which is used by humans, resides the Semantic Web. This variant of the web is an extension which is used by machines to automatically interpret documents on the web and as such extract information. This interpretation is facilitated through Linked Data, which augments the data with meta-information (data about the data), such as the location where it can find additional details.

However, several issues are yet to be solved. This paper will focus on one specific problem that can be solved using Linked Data. This problem involves finding a generic approach to both publishing as well as updating datasets. Common examples of this type of datasets include governmental data, such as the registry of addresses.
