On top of the standard web which is used by humans, resides the Semantic Web. This variant of the web is an extension which is used by machines to automatically interpret documents on the web and as such extract information. This interpretation is facilitated through Linked Data, which augments the data with meta-information (data about the data), such as the location where it can find additional details.
