## Data formatting
In this chapter, the way data is formatted is discussed. This chapter will describe possible formats to serialize RDF data, among which RDF/XML, RDFa, Turtle, N-Triples and JSON-LD. These different formats all have their own pros and cons, but more abother this later. Further more, techniques to receive RDF data from databases like SQL will be expressed. This part will show how data for databases can be transformed into RDF data, so it can be used for linked data querying.
