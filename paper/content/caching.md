## Data caching
This chapter will list, describe and compare existing techniques used to cache large open datasets.
Today caching is a viable strategy to work with datasets, because it is convenient to process complex queries locally.
This chapter will not only talk about data caches themselves, but also about multiple techniques to update caches dynamically using both push and pull protocols and about which subset of the data needs to be cached.
