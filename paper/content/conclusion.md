On the subject of data delivery, the achieved conclusion is the following, in order to achieve a generic framework or technology, a push-based delivery approach is required, 
since some use cases absolutely require this. Existing push-based approaches were discussed and with some research it should be possible to determine the best option for this framework.
In case the use case does not require a push-based approach, the data can simply be published regularly (i.e. using regular HTTP requests by the client), using a proper data format and model,
which we have both discussed in other chapters.
