## Conclusion
The goal of this paper was to investigate how we can apply existing technologies in the field of Linked Open Data to handle data streaming. We have performed a literature study and explained various techniques to define, version, distribute and cache this data. We have found multiple existing and viable technologies. We noticed in each section that technologies could be combined to possibly get a better performance. We have also noticed that the technologies in the different sections could be combined into a good working solution for updating open linked datasets with event streaming. This is why we promote the use of existing technologies to tackle this problem.
