## Conclusion
The goal of this paper was to investigate how we can apply existing technologies in the field of Linked Open Data to handle streaming data. We have performed a literature study and explained various formats to define the data, including metadata to describe the semantics. Next, we have presented two techniques to apply versioning, which allow synchronizing changes and distributing the dataset. The delivery of the data can be achieved either via pull- or push-based approaches, depending on the use case. Data which is not frequently updated can simply be exposed via a web interface, updates can be polled at will. However for highly volatile datasets, such as real-time data, a push mechanism is required. In order to reduce the stress on servers and increase scalability, multiple caching mechanisms have been provided. Finally, we have discussed the concept of Web Streams in a way that implements the presented techniques. Across all sections, we promote the use of existing technologies to ensure interoperability as well as extensibility.
