## Conclusion
The goal of this paper was to investigate how existing technologies can be applied in the field of Linked Open Data to handle data streaming. We have performed a literature study and explained various techniques to define, version, distribute and cache this data. Multiple existing and viable technologies have been found and in each section it was noticed that technologies could be combined to possibly get better performance. It was also noticed that a lot of research has been done at the protocol level, but research at higher levels may prove more beneficial. Furthermore, it was noticed that there exists better performing pull-based algorithms that have not yet been compared to a push-based approach. Finally, we propose that the technologies described in the different sections could be combined into a good working solution for distributing live open linked datasets with event streaming. However every dataset is different and for example, a dataset about parking spot availability needs an approach where the speed of distribution of data changes is prioritized, while for example, a dataset of addresses needs to prioritize access to this dataset at different times. We conclude that there is no single solution for this problem, but that for every variation of this problem a combination of existing technologies can lead to a viable solution. This is why we promote the use of existing technologies to tackle this problem.
