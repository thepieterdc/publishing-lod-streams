## Conclusion
The goal of this paper was to investigate how we can apply existing technologies in the field of Linked Open Data to handle data streaming. We have performed a literature study and explained various techniques to define, version, distribute and cache this data. We have found multiple existing and viable technologies. We noticed in each section that technologies could be combined to possibly get better performance. It was also noticed that a lot of research had been done at the protocol level, but it might be more useful to research technologies at a higher level. Furthermore, we noticed that there exist better performing pull-based algorithms that have not yet been compared to a push-based approach. Finally, we propose that the technologies described in the different sections could be combined into a good working solution for distributing live open linked datasets with event streaming. We do think that every dataset is different and that for example, a dataset about parking spot availability needs an approach where the speed of distribution of data changes is prioritized, while for example, a dataset of addresses needs to prioritize access to this dataset at different times. We conclude that different datasets need different approaches, but that existing technologies can be combined to achieve a good solution. This is why we promote the use of existing technologies to tackle this problem.
